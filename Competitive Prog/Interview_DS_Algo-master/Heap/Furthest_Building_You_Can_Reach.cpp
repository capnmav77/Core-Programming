//Greedy : Fail
class Solution {
public:
    int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        //greedily I'll use bricks because ladder helps me to jump to next
		//building irrespective of the height difference

                bricks -= diff;

                ladders--;

                break;

        return i;

};

Why above fails ?
Let's take an example :
[1,5,1,2,3,4,10000]
4
1
Initially:
bricks = 4
ladder = 1

        For, 1->5
        If I use bricks,
        bricks  = 4 - (5-1) = 0
        ladders = 1
        
        Now, 
        5->1 costs nothing
        
        For, 1->2
        I will use my only ladder
        bricks  = 0
        ladders = 0
        
        So, i reached till 2 (i.e. index 3 only) WRONG ANSWER
        
        -----------------------
        Now, if i had used ladder from 1->5, let's see what difference it
		would have created
        For, 1->5
        If I use ladder this time,
        bricks  = 4
        ladders = 0
        
        Now, 
        5->1 costs nothing
        
        For, 1->2
        I will use bricks
        bricks  = 4 - (2-1) = 3
        ladders = 0
        
        Now, for 2->3, I have bricks which can help me (as I need only (3-2) brick out of 3 bricks available)
        bricks  = 3 - (3-2) = 2
        ladders = 0
        
        For 3->4, I have bricks which can help me (as I need only (4-3) brick out of 2 bricks available)
        bricks  = 2 - (4-3) = 1
        ladders = 0
        
        Now, I can't go to 1000 from 4.
        So, I reached till 4 (i.e. index 5) RIGHT ANSWER
        
        So, what to do ?
        Just keep track of maximum amount of bricks you had used in past (say maxBricks). 
        Before, using a ladder, have look that the curr difference(diff = heights[i+1]-heights[i]) is smaller
        than last maximum amount of bricks you had used. So, we can regain those bricks and use a ladder    
        instead in the past. This way, you saved (maxBricks - diff) amount of bricks which can be used later
