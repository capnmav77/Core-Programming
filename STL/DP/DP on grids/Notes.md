## DP on grids 

1.Count Paths
    - total unique Paths
    - 0,0 to m-1 , n-1 => find the total number of unique paths from source to destination
    i - express everything in terms of indexes i,j where i-row j-cols
    ii - explore all paths 
    iii - sum up all the ways / max / min .

    Memoization -> tabulation 
        i- declare base case 
        ii- express various[all] states in for loops
        iii- copy the recurrence and write
